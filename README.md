# AlienSoccer

This project was made by a team of three students that I was part of at Complubot.

We built two robots that played soccer coordinately with a ball that emited infrared light.
The robots were able to detect the ball as well as recognize certain parts of the field like the white limitational lines on it that the robots couldn't cross. Also they detected the field's walls as well as each other using ultrasounds.
Both robots where identically built and the operated with the same software, anyway we had different game modes like goalkeeper or player to modify their behavior.

//Talk about the rules

## Main caracteristics
* High modularity, the robots had eight processors distributed along them, each one was in charge of a specific task, making every part of the robot independent of the others. We detected wich parts where connected to the robot and operate eith them. Also one independant part could make all its functionality without the others. This made much easier the building procces because we could work in multiple parts of the robot at the same time, also testing them was faster. If one part was damaged during a game we could replace it completely with a new one in less than a minute, also the same part could operate in any robot.
* Easy to test
* Fast computing 
* Big dimensions
